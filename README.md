I am going to explore adding the following new features and updates in quite rapid succession. 


#1 adding more recent windows OS support by simply listing them ( without testing each to see if it actually works ) 
- windows 11
- windows server 2022
- windows server 2025

#2 add local html file creation instead of emails as new default reporting mechanism

#3 get the list of machines to be processed by csv file rather than AD discovery queries

#3 move EmailAddresses, To, From, and passwords out to DPAPI protected xml file that can be git ignored in order to keep secrets out of git repos

#4 adding powershell-core 7.x support for parallel processing
